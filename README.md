Generate multi-unit schematic symbols for KiCad from a CSV, text, or
Excel file.

-   Free software: MIT license
-   Documentation: <https://devbisme.github.io/KiPart>.

## Features

-   Generates schematic part libraries for KiCad from CSV/text/Excel
    files.
-   Converts lists of pins in a file into a multi-unit schematic part
    symbol.
-   Converts multiple files stored in .zip archives.
-   Each row of the file lists the number, name, type, style, unit and
    side of a pin.
-   Pins on a unit with the same name (e.g., GND) can be placed at the
    same location so they can all be tied to the same net with a single
    connection.
-   Also includes `kilib2csv` for converting schematic part libraries
    into CSV files suitable for input to KiPart.

## Example Use Case

From a user:

I had a very complex library for a microprocessor that I needed to
refactor--- I needed to reorder hundreds of pins in a sane human-usable
format. I thought I was going to have do it by hand in KiCAD\'s
graphical symbol editor. I tried that, got very frustrated with all the
clicking and dragging.

So I then:

-   searched and found this tool,
-   used `kilib2csv` to export my KiCAD lib to CSV,
-   imported the CSV in a spreadsheet program
-   edited the spreadsheet (mainly sorting the pins by function using
    the spreadsheet\'s `sort()` function),
-   exported the spreadsheet back to CSV,
-   used `kipart` to export back to KiCAD.

Boom! Usable part in minutes.
