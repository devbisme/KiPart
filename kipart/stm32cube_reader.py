    STM32CubeMx is a tool for creating firmware projects for STM32
    MCUs. It also includes a pin layout designer which can export the
    list of pins in the form of a CSV file. This will read the csv
    file and return a dictionary of pin data.

    An example output of the STM32CubeMx tool can be seen below:

    "Position","Name","Type","Signal","Label"
    "1","VBAT","Power","",""
    "2","PC13-ANTI_TAMP","I/O","",""
    "3","PC14-OSC32_IN","I/O","RCC_OSC32_IN",""
    "4","PC15-OSC32_OUT","I/O","RCC_OSC32_OUT",""
    ...

    Pin names for the symbols will be constructed as "Name/Signal". If
    user defined label is specified it will be used instead of
    "Signal" column.

    All IO pins will be grouped to units per their ports.
    Configuration related pins such as boot, clock etc will be grouped
    as a separate unit. Power pins will be a separate unit as well.
